**NOTE:**  
This project builds on top of MCP's early concepts, including a Go-based SDK.  
Please consult the `LICENSES/` directory for full license attributions (MIT/BSD) for Google and Anthropic work.

## ğŸ¯ Goal

To experiment with the under-development MCP Go SDK and learn more about MCPâ€™s structure and implementation patterns.

This project also serves as a boilerplate and sandbox to explore roadmap concepts from the official MCP homepage.

This allows a user to author MCP Clients, MCP Servers as well as orchestrate the desired infrastructure to run them on (docker, k8s, serverless) 

---

## ğŸ—‚ Project Layout

- `client_app/` â€“ Go-based MCP client that connects to an MCP server and interacts using the protocol.
- `server_app/` â€“ Go-based MCP server that handles requests from clients, optionally routes to LLMs or external services.
- `explorer_ux/` â~@~S Vue.js (argon/bootstrap) UX interface for Authoring MCP Clients, MCP Servers and infrastructure to deploy your MCPs on.
- `mcp_src/` â€“ Sourced from [googlesource.com/tools/internal/mcp](https://go.googlesource.com/tools/internal/mcp), adjusted for standalone use.

## ğŸš€ How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Build the following components:
   - `server_app`
   - `client_app`
   - `registry_app`
   - `explorer_ux`
3. Run all four applications.

### Application Endpoints

Adjust for your IP or hostname:

- **Explorer UX** â†’ `https://<your-ip>:9000/`
- **Server Manager** â†’ `https://<your-ip>:10010/swagger/index.html`
- **Client Manager** â†’ `https://<your-ip>:10011/swagger/index.html`
- **Registry Manager** â†’ `https://<your-ip>:10012/swagger/index.html`
