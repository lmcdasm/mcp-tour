**NOTE:**  
This project builds on top of MCP's early concepts, including a Go-based SDK.

## 🎯 Goal

To experiment with the under-development MCP Go SDK and learn more about MCP’s structure and implementation patterns.

This project also serves as a boilerplate and sandbox to explore roadmap concepts from the official MCP homepage.

---

## 🗂 Project Layout

- `client_app/` – Go-based MCP client that connects to an MCP server and interacts using the protocol.
- `server_app/` – Go-based MCP server that handles requests from clients, optionally routes to LLMs or external services.
- `mcp_src/` – Sourced from [googlesource.com/tools/internal/mcp](https://go.googlesource.com/tools/internal/mcp), adjusted for standalone use.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Build the following components:
   - `server_app`
   - `client_app`
   - `registry_app`
   - `explorer_ux`
3. Run all four applications.

### Application Endpoints

Adjust for your IP or hostname:

- **Explorer UX** → `https://<your-ip>:9000/`
- **Server Manager** → `https://<your-ip>:10010/swagger/index.html`
- **Client Manager** → `https://<your-ip>:10011/swagger/index.html`
- **Registry Manager** → `https://<your-ip>:10012/swagger/index.html`
