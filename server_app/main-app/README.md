# Models

Here is where structs for things like Requests, Responses and such should go to keep things nice and tidy.
These are used for Swagger as well so people can see the models and such and know what the send/returns look like.

# Types

 - request.go - this is where Structs for Requests should sit ideally
 - response.go - this is where structs for modeled responses should go ideally
